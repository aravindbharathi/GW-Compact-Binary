# GW Compact Binary

Documentation and code repository for the PH 821 course project. The final submission can be viewed [here](gwsignal.ipynb). The results are presented in the form of a python notebook which has `numpy`, `matplotlib` and `yaml` as its only dependencies. 

The code simulates gravitational waves produced during the inspiral phase of compact binaries in circular orbits under linearised gravity. Each of these components can be independently extended. 

A static image of the ring of test particles is shown below

An example of the dynamic spectrum that can be obtained using the code is shown below
